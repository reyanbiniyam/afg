        <h1>What are the challenges?</h1>
        <p>There are some unique challenges companies may face when doing business in Ethiopia. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Low quality and coverage of infrastructure</li>
          <li>Ranks 111 out of 177 on the corruption index</li>
          <li>Inconsistencies in tax assessments and excessive penalties</li>
          <li>Occasional delays in accessing foreign exchange (sometimes months)</li>
          <li>Can take up to 75 days to clear imports</li>
          <li>The industry sector is small and import-dependant, making it vulnerable to foreign exchange shortages</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ethiopia is engaged in a program of economic reform and liberalisation. However, the state remains heavily involved in most economic sectors. Some sectors, particularly in services, are hard for foreign investors to enter. Ethiopia retains control over the utilities sector and prohibits foreign ownership of banking and insurance companies. Land cannot be purchased or sold, but can be leased, sometimes on a long-term basis.</p>
        <p>All imports are required to be channelled through Ethiopian nationals registered as official import or distribution agents with the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Furthermore, customs clearance remains a hindrance to the business of importing â€“ the clearance process is slow and imported goods are sometimes charged at attributed values instead of invoice values.</p>
        <p>Contractual enforcement remains weak, and as a result, many local companies prefer to do business with relatives or close acquaintances.</p>
        <p>The transportation and telecommunications systems, especially internet service, are improving and infrastructure development has been prioritised in recent budgets.</p>
