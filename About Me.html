        <p>Hi iam reyan biniyam, and i think trying to smile for pictures always feels really awkward .</p>
        <p>
         People will think it looks forced won't they? Aren't they going to laugh at how it gives me a double chin? But then i remember that quote that always get attributed to eleanor roosevelt
 "you probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you could know how seldom they do"

        </p>
